# MealMaster
MealMaster is a search engine for recipes that allows users to easily find and save their favorite dishes. With a user-friendly interface and powerful search functionality, MealMaster makes it easy for users to discover new recipes and plan their meals.

## Tech stack
MealMaster is built using the following technologies:

- Front-end: React.js used for building the user interface.
- Back-end: Node.js used for implementing the server-side logic.
- Database: MongoDB used for storing the recipe data.
- ElasticSearch: For advanced quering of the data.

# Goals
The goal of MealMaster is to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive search engine for recipes. Some key features include:

- A powerful search engine that allows users to search for recipes by keyword, ingredient, cuisine type, and more.
- The ability to filter search results by various parameters, such as cooking time, dietary restrictions, and more
- A user system that allows users to save their favorite recipes, create their own recipes, and rate and review recipes created by others
- A responsive design that makes the search engine easy to use on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets
